i dunno, what do you want me to say?  its a font that allows you to make pictures of burgers.

## Known Issues

- if you want a sesame seed bun you need to include the normal bun underneath it, theres a special class for that.  otherwise the sesame seeds will be transparent.

- because it makes more sense to go top to bottom the z-index of the elements would naturally be messed up and lower elements would be on top, to get around this i literally set the z-index of the first 30 or so elements underneath a burger, if you need more proceed in that fashion

- the bacon does not really seem *'bacony'* enough to me
